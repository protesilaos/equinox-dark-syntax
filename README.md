# Equinox syntax theme (dark version)

Medium-to-high contrast theme. Its overall presentation hints towards the blue side of spectrum. The most prevalent colours are variants of blue, purple, teal, and cyan complemented by warmer tones of light brown and magenta.

*Equinox* comes in standalone light and dark versions (see further info below).

*JavaScript demo is source code of [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/)*
